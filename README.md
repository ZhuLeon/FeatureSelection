# Feature Selection
Analyze a data set of features and finds the set of features that give the highest accuracy of classifying an object. Uses three methods:

The user will be prompted with directions. 
I've included a traceback of a solution as an example:

## Notes
This was done for a Artifical Intelligence course studying machine learning.

## Other
Not sure if backwards elimination is correct
