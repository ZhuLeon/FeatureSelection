# Feature Selection
Analysis a data set of features and finds the set of features that give a good chance of classifying something. Uses three methods:

2. Backwards Elimination  
3. Modified Forward Search (slightly faster forward search)

## How to use
To compile, use the makefile by typing `make` into the terminal window. 
The user will be prompted with directions. 
I've included a traceback of a solution as an example:

## Notes
This was done for a Artifical Intelligence course studying machine learning.

## Other
Not sure if backwards elimination is correct
